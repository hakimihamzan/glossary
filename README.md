# [Glossary](https://hakimihamzan.github.io/glossary/)

This webpage was designed to demonstrate my skills with JavaScript.
It consists of three main files. Index.html, glossaryData.js and glossary.js. Its is a full fledge webpage with its entire content dynamically generated using JavaScript.


___

glossaryData.js contains an array of objects that mostly contains terms, definition, tags.



```javascript

let glossary = [
  {
    term: "Virtual Machine",
    class: 00,
    definition:
      "A computer system emulator. A way to run other operating systems on your machine",
    tags: ["General"],
  },

// and more ..........

```

glossary.js is where all the magic happens. Processing data etc. is done here.
